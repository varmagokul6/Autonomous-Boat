# Autonomous-Boat

As part of a robotics course at the University of California, Irvine, I worked to develop, in a team of four, an autonomous aquatic robot that would mimic a rescue boat. The boat would respond to thermal variations that represent the body temperature of a human being, while also taking high frequency noises, representing a human scream, as an input. For this project, I was in charge of implementing the finite-state machine and integrating the sensors and motors to the boat.



## Objective
The objective of the project was to design an autonomous boat that would be capable of reaching specific points in the challenge where there is a high frequency detection or strange temperature distributions, both of which mimic a human drowning in a body of water. 

## Requirements
<li>
  System must be able to float, navigate, and maneuver through water.
</li>
<li>
  System must be able to detect and respond to a temperature above a specified threshold. 
</li>
<li>
  System must be able to detect and respond to a frequency above a specified threshold. 
</li>
<li>
  System must be able to navigate to said inputs (temperature and frequency) and become stationary upon arrival.
</li>
<li>
  Must conform to budget ($120)
</li>
